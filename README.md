## Code-201 Final Project

This app is a Rock Paper Scissors game with a leaderboard that saves data after each round, and an About Us page. The gameplay will feature multiple opponents with different strategies and gambits, the goal is to get the most wins within a certain number of rounds, and then win against the highest number of opponents in a row.
