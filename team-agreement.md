## Conflict Plan  

* What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?  
  *We should pitch the conflict to the group and discuss in depth ways to solve it whether that's through majority rules or compromisation. The hope is that everyone will be on board to being open to collaboration. Some personal sacrifice will be needed.*  

* What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?  
  *Being open to confrontation and address the issue directly is important. We should all be open to feedback and implementing said feedback when given to us. We should also encourage collaboration.*  

* How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?  
  *We should lean into being excellent towards eachother. Also we should give eachother the space to make mistakes and amicably correct eachother when mistakes are made. We should make sure everyone is having their own growth moments.*  

* How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?  
  *During daily standups, observing deadlines and making sure everyone is hitting them. If their is a pattern of missing deadlines, we should definitely raise concerns during the standups to this individual and if they still do not contribute, we should bring our concerns to our instructor.*  

* How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?  
  *If holding eachother accountable isn't enough in certain situations, bringing our concerns to the instructor and asking for advice will be the way we escalate these issues.*  

## Communication Plan

  *Remo; slack; phone (last resort)*

* How often will you take breaks?  
  *1 hour break at noon PST; Agreed upon 10 minute breaks as needed if working in pairs*  

* What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
  *Really strive for MVP. Go over MVP again as a group and reflect on what takes priority.*  

* How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?  
  *Through slack and phone (if emergency)*  

* What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?  
  *We are all ok being called on. We need to call on them in an amicable way and we all understand that sometimes we don't have ideas.*  

* How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?
  *Being open and having empathy; not judging other's ideas; respectful feedback*  

## Work Plan
